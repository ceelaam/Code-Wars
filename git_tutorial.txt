when you make some bundle of changes, that solve a problem or are logically coherent you will make a commit
first you will open the console(ctrl shift `) and then

git add .

this will "stage" the changes and you can do this any number of times

when everything is staged you will type

git commit -m "this describes the changes in this commit"

then

git push

that will push the changes to the repository
